Hello!

Flappybird is now available as an app (flappybird.exe)
I am working on a version for linux (I have the executable for linux, I just haven't figured how to package it yet)
NO ADMIN RIGHTS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE APP'S USE This means that it can be run on school computers
When downloading the app, you will probably get a lot of popups telling you it is a virus, click install or run anyway.
(often you have to click the 3 dots or learn more to get that option)
Enjoy!
