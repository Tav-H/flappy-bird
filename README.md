# flappy-bird
Play flappy bird!

game takes a while to load :(

click or spacebar to jump


Flappybird is now available as an app (flappybird.exe)
I am working on a version for linux (I have the executable for linux, I just haven't figured how to package it yet)
NO ADMIN RIGHTS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE APP'S USE This means that it can be run on school/work computers
When downloading the app, you will probably get a lot of popups telling you it is a virus, click install or run anyway.
(often you have to click the 3 dots or learn more to get that option)

Enjoy!
